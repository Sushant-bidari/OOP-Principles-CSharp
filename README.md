# OOP-Principles-CSharp
A C# console application demonstrating the four main Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.

## Features
- Encapsulation – Protects internal class data using private fields and public properties.
- Inheritance – Enables a class to reuse properties and methods from a parent class.
- Abstraction – Uses abstract classes to hide implementation details.
- Polymorphism – Allows method overriding for flexible and dynamic behavior.

Each principle is implemented in its own demo class for clarity and easy understanding.
